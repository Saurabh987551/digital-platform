Figures include ODA with a stated relevance to pneumonia vaccines, research, treatment and diagnosis as determined by a key-word search on ODA project descriptions for pneumonia-relevant words. Proportions are applied to calculate the pneumonia expenditure in partially relevant projects and to estimate the cost of the pneumonia-relevant component of combination vaccines. Methodology based on that developed by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and used in the 2014 publication ‘Pushing the Pace: Progress and Challenges in Fighting Childhood Pneumonia’."
